# Angular DIO Blog

This project is a simple portfolio blog project created as a practical application of the knowledge gained from the Angular course at [DIO platform](https://www.dio.me/). It showcases some features and functionalities developed throughout the course, demonstrating skills in Angular components, routing, directives, component lifeCycle and more. The project serves as both a learning tool and a portfolio piece to highlight my growth as a developer.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.5.

## Features

- **Design:** Followed the design layout made by [Jordan Hughes on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/jordanhughes)

- **Dynamic Routing:** Utilizes Angular Router for seamless navigation between different blog posts.

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Each section of the blog is built using reusable components for better maintainability.

- **Data Fetching:** Fetches blog post data from a TypeScript file within the project for easy management and modification.
